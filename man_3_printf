.SH NAME
_printf \- custom implementation of the C standard printf function

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include "main.h"
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf() is a custom recreation of the standard C printf function.
It formats and prints output according to a format string followed
by a variable number of arguments.

The format string contains ordinary characters, which are printed
as-is, and conversion specifiers introduced by the percent '%' sign.

Supported conversion specifiers include:

.TP
.B %c
Prints a single character.

.TP
.B %s
Prints a null-terminated string.

.TP
.B %%
Prints a literal percent sign.

.TP
.B %d, %i
Prints a signed integer in base 10.

Additional helper functions located across the project branches
(main, Kevin, and Fabiola) handle parsing, specifier processing,
and buffered output.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, _printf() returns the number of characters printed.
On failure, it returns -1.

.SH EXAMPLES
Example usage:

.nf
_printf("Hello %s! You are %d years old.\n", "Kevin", 25);
.fi

.SH NOTES
This implementation does not yet support all standard printf
specifiers such as %f, %p, %x, or width/precision modifiers.
Only the specifiers implemented within this repository are
guaranteed to work.

.SH SEE ALSO
printf(3), putchar(3)
